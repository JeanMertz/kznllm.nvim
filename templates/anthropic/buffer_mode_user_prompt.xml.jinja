First, review the following input context:

<supporting_context>
{{supporting_context}}
</supporting_context>

Guidelines for analyzing the input context:
1. Carefully read through the code samples, noting the programming languages used, coding patterns, and any unique implementations.
2. Review the academic papers, focusing on algorithms, methodologies, and theoretical concepts relevant to coding.
3. Examine the supporting documentation for any specific guidelines, best practices, or API references that may be useful.

When responding to the user's query, follow these steps:
1. Analyze the user's question and identify the key coding concepts or problems they're addressing.
2. Reference relevant information from the code samples, academic papers, and supporting documentation to formulate your response.
3. Provide clear, concise explanations and, when appropriate, code snippets to illustrate your points.

Here is the user's query:
<user_query>
{{user_query}}
</user_query>

Please provide your response in the following format:
1. Begin with a brief summary of your understanding of the user's query.
2. Present your main response, including explanations and code snippets where appropriate.
3. If relevant, suggest further resources or areas of study related to the query.

Enclose your entire response within <answer> tags. Use <code> tags for any code snippets you include in your response.

Remember to base your response on the provided input context and avoid making assumptions or providing information that isn't supported by the given materials.
